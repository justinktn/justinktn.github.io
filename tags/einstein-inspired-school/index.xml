      <description>What would be the design of the school&amp;rsquo;s curriculum?
The design of the school&amp;rsquo;s curriculum that Albert Einstein wants to be based on the story &amp;ldquo;On Education (1936)&amp;rdquo;, it should be subject-centered, learner-centered, and problem-centered because I believe that education is not about learning facts but thinking about ideas. No student would be required to study the same topics. Instead of making a student feel unintelligent because he was unable to comprehend the topic being taught by their teachers, we should encourage students to enhance their talents and creative thinking.</description>
