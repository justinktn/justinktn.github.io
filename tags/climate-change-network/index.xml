      <description>“You cannot heal in the same environment where you got sick.” – Anonymous Concept Web:
 Introduction:
If you don&amp;rsquo;t allow your wounds the space they need to breathe and regenerate, they won&amp;rsquo;t ever heal. Always find for the better changes rather than always using the same practice that makes you sick. Let go of the bad practices and always have the strength to remain true to ourselves.
We all fail and I do believe that trying and failing is always better than not trying at all and never be hesitant to attempt new things for the better of our lives.</description>
